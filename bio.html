			<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Management Analytics for Social Good at the Telfer School of Management within the University of Ottawa. </p>

			<p>My research focuses on developing and applying actionable analytics to solve health and humanitarian problems. I am interested in pursuing a diverse set of applications that are unified by my theoretical interests, which primarily focus on the interface between predictive and prescriptive analytics. I am particularly motivated by global and planetary health because I believe these areas have potential for significant practical impact, while motivating novel problem-driven theory at the intersection of optimization and machine learning.</p>

			<p>My work has been recognized by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS): once been runner-up (2020) and twice finalist (2021, 2022) for the Pierskalla Best Paper Award, honorable mention for the Doing Good with Good OR Paper competition (2021), and as a PhD student, I won the Seth Bonder Scholarship for Applied Operations Research in Health Services (2017). </p>

			<p>I received a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics from Acadia University, a Ph.D. in Operations Research from the University of Toronto, and I was a postdoctoral associate with the Humanitarian Supply Chain Lab and the Center for Transportation and Logistics at MIT. Prior to joining the University of Ottawa, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering and an Affiliated Faculty in the BerbeeWalsh Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Wisconsin Madison. </p>
